BLD-R2-11-0
	Jeremy Mock: 2020-04-23 on git branch master
  Built against event-R4-2-5-CLTS-R3, udpComm-R2-7-1-BR-1, fcom-R1-3-35-BR-2,
    and fcomUtil-R1-2-4-BR-2 in EPICS-R3-14-12 for changes to timing for multiple beamlines
  Change PV names (and blob names) from LTU1 -> LTUH, UND1->UNDH, DMP1->DMPH

BLD-R2-10-1
	Bruce Hill: 2018-02-16 on git branch master
	Discovered that only a few BPM's were enabled in the eOrbits BLD packet.
	This release just enables the pv's to add the additional records
	needed to add the remaining BPM's to the eOrbits BLD packet.

BLD-R2-10-0
	Bruce Hill: 2018-02-16 on git branch master
	Added GDET BLD Rcvr to BldSender app and ioc-sys0-bd01

	Restored BLDMCastReceiver files

BLD-R2-9-2
	Bruce Hill: 2017-05-24 on git branch master
	Tag made before master branch the BLD Rcvr commits were merged from dev branch.

BLD-R2-9-1
	Bruce Hill: 2016-08-17 on MAIN_TRUNK
	Replaced TS1 event codes w/ TS4 event codes and enabled VME IRQ for EC 40

BLD-R2-9-0
	Bruce Hill: 2016-08-11 on MAIN_TRUNK
	Updated ioc st.cmd files so ioc-sys0-bd01 sends both eBeam and eOrbits BLD
		and vioc-sys0-bd03 just sends dummy eBeam BLD to 254
	Updated to build RTEMS vs event-R4-2-4 and linux vs evrClient-R1-0-p7.
	Also updates to fcomUtil-R1-2-4 for duplicate timestamp checks on calls to fcomGetBlob()
	Modified to use udpComm instead of posix socket calls so we can send eOrbits BLD from RTEMS
	Reworked st.vmegeneric.cmd and st.fnetgeneric.b34.cmd to be compatible w/ envPaths being source in st.cmd
	Tweaked debug variables in vioc-b34-bd03/st.cmd and added an evr only vioc-sys0-bd03-test
	Added some timing diagnostics and fixed eOrbitsFcom.substitutions

BLD-R2-8-0
	Bruce Hill: 2016-06-19 on MAIN_TRUNK
	Adding support for sending eOrbits BLD packets.
	Includes new fcomUtil support for subscribing to FCOM via db files.
	CA connectionCallback added so CA PV's can reconnect as needed.
		Only works for new evrClient EVR driver on linux or linuxRT.
	Adding support for eOrbits BLD packets and allowing independent enable of eBeam and/or eOrbits BLD
	Adding new EORBITS support
	Updated to use new drvFcom support to allow testing in development environment
		with simulated FCOM traffic needed for eBeam and eOrbits BLD support.

BLD-R2-7-7:
	Bruce Hill: 27-May-2016: on MAIN_TRUNK
		Fixed several problems w/ VME IOC files from bad commit.

BLD-R2-7-6:
	Bruce Hill: 23-Mar-2016: on MAIN_TRUNK
		Having trouble w/ linuxRT system staying up, so changed
		vioc-sys0-bd03 back to 502 pv series and 239.255.24.254 mcast group.
		VME ioc-sys0-bd01 back to production 500 series pv's and eBeam BLDID.
		Set BLDMCAST_DST_IP from env var
		Added call to udpCommSetMCastTTL so our multicast BLD gets beyond local subnet.
		Also added a reset_dispersal_pvs.sh script

BLD-R2-7-5:
	Bruce Hill: 09-Mar-2016: on MAIN_TRUNK

	Bruce Hill: 16-Oct-2015: on MAIN_TRUNK
		Switched BSA and received FCOM pv's from 502 to 500 for vioc-sys0-bd03
			so it can take over support for these PV's from ioc-sys0-bd01
		Changed ioc-sys0-bd01 from 500 to 502 and disabled BLD multicast so it
			can be run without conflicts in parallel w/ vioc-sys0-bd03 for
			diagnostic comparisons.
		Note:  Either ioc-sys0-bd01 should be retired or both vioc-sys0-bd03
			and ioc-sys-bd01 should run BLD-R2-7-3 in order to avoid conflicts.

BLD-R2-7-2:
	Bruce Hill: 16-Oct-2015: on MAIN_TRUNK
		Merged RT-devel branch to MAIN_TRUNK
		Effectively the same ioc as BLD-R2-7-1
		vioc-sys0-bd03 still using modified pv's and bld addr to avoid conflicts

BLD-R2-7-1:
	Bruce Hill: 16-Oct-2015: on RT-devel branch

		Removed stale obsolete code
		Split fcom timeout status from tsMismatch status
		Added PV's for monitoring additional blobs for DMP_CH and XTCAV_AMP
		Modified bld_diagnostics screen to use emb-fcom-stats.edl for easier
			management and addition of new blobs.

    if the code is not running on ioc-sys0-bd01

BLD-R2-4-5:
  o Found bug created by adding more FCOM PVs/Blobs. Code is missing
    checks to make sure arrays are not overrun -> Must review/refactor the
    BLDMCast code.

    ioc-sys0-bd01 in production

BLD-R2-4-2:
  o Fixed wrong BLD IP address in multicast BLD receiver - dbior bug fix

	BLD:SYS0:500:FITTIME2

    There are also a couple of BSA PVs to provide
    PULSEID and STATUS information:

	BLD:SYS0:500:PULSEID
	BLD:SYS0:500:STATUS

    The Phase Cavity BLD is always *at least* one
    PULSEID behind. The PULSEID BSA PV must be
    checked to make sure data from other devices line
    up correctly.

BLD-R2-1-1: (BLD-R2-0-0-BR branch)

    to the BSA records.

    BC2Energy - BPMS:LI24:801:X (in mm)
    BC1Charge - BLEN:LI21:265:AIMAX (in amps)
    BC1Energy - BPMS:LI21:233:X (in mm)

  o Change EBEAMINFO.ebeamBunchLen to EBEAMINFO.ebeamBC2Current

  o Change in outgoing data packet
    Version from 0x1000f to 0x2000f
    Addition of 3 extra words (for the energy/charge above)
