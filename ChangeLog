	20100518 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/Db/BLDMCast.db:
	 o Introduced a new macro to set SCAN field of old diagnostic BLD
	   data records. These are deprecated anyways and in a first cut
	   to phase them out we set them to Passive from the startup script.
	   If a user desperately needs them then we can set SCAN -> I/O Intr
	   at run-time.
	 o Shortened DESC that was too long.
	 o Added missing brace.

	* BLDApp/Db/IOC-SYS0-BD01.substitutions: Enabled VME interrupt for EVENT7 
	(which uses event code 146) so that we can use 'Event' scanning with event 146.

	* BLDApp/Db/Makefile: install BLDMCastWfRecv.db.

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c:
	 o must compute FCOM IDs and subscribe prior to allocating blob set.  
	 o increment bldFcomGetErrors[] only if fcomGetBlob() or
	   fcomGetBlobSet() failed - not if data from a set is missing (this is
	   already counted as a bad timestamp).
	 o FIXED: computation of latency average (must right shift *signed* difference).
	 o FIXED: declaration of timer_delay_rd/timer_delay_wr (silence gcc warning).
	 o beautification of 'report' printout.

	* BLDApp/src/Makefile: Add devBLDMCastWfRecv devsup to BLD IOC app.

	* BLDApp/src/devBLDMCastWfRecv.c: compute statistics only if something
	is received w/o timeout.

	* BLDApp/srcDisplay/bld_diagnostics.edl: updated and renamed (added 
	coeffTable to display BLD data).

	* BLDApp/srcDisplay/Makefile: added.

	* iocBoot/ioc-sys0-bd01/st.cmd:
	 o load 'BLDMCastWfRecv.db' and supply with macros.
	 o BLDMCast.db now requires STAT_SCAN and DIAG_SCAN macros.

	* configure/RELASE: updated to use latest modules.

	20100517 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/srcDisplay/: Added EDM display to CVS.

	20100517 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/Db/BLDMCast.c:
	 o added counters for average latency measurement.
	 o added counters to measure total latency (until BLD packet it
	   handed to network stack).
	 o removed some debugging code.
	 o moved allocation of blob set to driver 'init' function so that
	   the record which reads the operating 'mode' can be processed just
	   a single time via PINI.

	20100517 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/Db/BLDMCastWfRecv.db: added macros to set 'SCAN',
	'EVNT' and 'RARM' fields.

	20100517 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/Db/BLDMCast.db: 
	 o changed scanning of statistics from '10 second' to '$(SCAN_STAT)' macro
	 o added records to read and reset latency counters.
	 o added record to show 'mode' (FCOM set vs. async mode).

	20100517 (Till Straumann):

	* README: document 'bldget' + 'devBLDMCastRecvWf'.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: moved CA channel creation into a separate
	subroutine.
	
	Let 'report' function print the compile-time options.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/devBLDMCastWfRecv.c: Added 'report' function. Dumps
	statistics when interest level > 0.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* iocBoot/ioc-sys0-bd01/st.cmd: updated startup file to setup/initialize
	2nd NIC for udpComm/FCOM.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/bldget.c: Set default port and MC address in 
	subroutine instead of main program. This way they can used
	from RTEMS, too.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/Makefile: Build 'bldrx' example application and
	which the devBLDMcastWfRecv device support.

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.dbd: Removed DELAY_FROM_FIDUCIAL variable.
	This is now controllable via an EPICS record (and obsolete anyways
	if FCOM blob sets are working).

	20100426 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: 
	 o Use new algorithm to create CA connections. Due to slow reconnection
	   we now just try and try until we succeed.
	 o Added statistics counters/timers for measuring min and max
	   delay (from fiducial) when fcomGetBlobSet() returns.
	 o Moved initialization of bldIoscan and bldMutex to driver init
	   function so that they are available even if the BLD task is not
	   running yet.
	 o Removed rate limitation if USE_PULSE_CA is undefined. We want
	   to work on all pulses where beam is announced (mod5 has BEAMFULL
	   set).
	 o FIXED: good return value of devBusMappedRegister() is non-NULL.

	20100422 (Till Straumann):
 	
	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Use new FCOM blob sets to obtain data
	w/o the need to read after a timer delay. Reading a 'set' returns
	as soon as all data are available.

	20100420 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h: changed __ld_le64() so that it no longer
	modifies data in place but uses a scratch area. A 'load' operation
	should not have side-effects!

	20100415 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/Db/BLDMCast.db: Added records for reading statistics and
	setting the FCOM sampling delay.

	20100413 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c, BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.dbd: removed
	DELAY_FROM_FIDUCIAL; this parameter is now controlled via a record.
	
	20100413 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/devBLDMcastWfRecv.c, BLDApp/src/devBLDMcastWfRecv.dbd,
	BLDApp/src/bldrx_evr.dbd, BLDApp/Db/BLDMCastWfRecv.db:
	Added waveform device support that reads BLD packets into a waveform.

	20100413 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: register statistics counters and
	timer delay with devBusMapped so that they can be read/written
	using EPICS records.

	20100413 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h: moved (and renamed) definition of
	destination MC address and port number.

	20100408 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c, BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h,
	BLDApp/src/devBLDMcastStatus.c: Use 'bld' prefix for all global
	variables.

	Added C++ 'extern "C"' in header.

	Some beautification and elimination of dead code.

	20100401 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Cannot use a UdpComm packet buffer to store
	ebeam data because the device support stuff accesses the same buffer.
	Hence it has to be copied anyways :-(. Therefore we use udpCommSend()...

	20100401 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Added code to send using udpComm rather
	than straight BSD sockets.

	20100401 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: FIXED arithmetics when setting HW timer
	(used 32-bit operations, storing result only into 64-bit which let
	the result be truncated and way too small).

	Added per-PV unmatched timestamp counters.

	Added some more debugging code (to be removed eventually).

	20100401 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Read fast data from FCOM (1st shot at things).

	20100326 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Use timestamp returned by evrTimeGetFromPipeline()
	as a reference that must be matched by all PVs.
	Rather than memcmp()ing timestamps: check their pulse ID and verify
	that the timestamps match within a few minutes.

	20100326 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/bldget.c, BLDApp/src/Makefile: Added test program
	to receive and dump BLD packet.

	20100326 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c, BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h,
	BLDApp/src/devBLDMcastStatus.c: Removed little-endian copy of
	ebeamInfo as well as memcpy that initialized it.
	ebeamInfo is now maintained in LE format directly and we use
	(hopefully) more efficient ways to byteswap.

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c, BLDApp/src/Makefile: replaced hardcoded
	IP address of MC interface by 'getenv("IPADDR1")'. IPADDR1 can be set
	via fcomUtil so we added fcomUtil to the included dbds and libs.

	20100325 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: Removed 'ca_add_event' -- 'ca_add_array_event'
	works for a single element, too (and ca_add_event is just a macro mapping
	to the ca_add_array_event).

	Replaced per-PV 'dataAvailable' flag by a global bitset which can be
	tested more efficiently.

	Restructured some #ifdefs so that {} are always balanced (helps
	the editor).

	Replaced explicit pulse ID calculation by 'official' PULSEID() macro
	from event module.

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h: Replaced 'unsigned int' and 'double' by
	more portable epicsUInt32 / epicsFloat64.

	* BLDApp/src/devBLDMcastStatus.c: Removed pre-3.14 #ifdefed stuff.
	moved 'recGblSetSevr()' out of critical section. It may be cheap
	but that's not necessarily obvious to the reader.

	20100324 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: use c99 designated initializers to ensure
	that array entries match associated enums.

	20100323 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c: removed inclusion of unnecessary headers.

	20100323 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.c, BLDApp/src/BLDMCast.h:
	Moved non-public declarations and in particular, definition of 'static' variables
	from BLDMCast.h -> BLDMCast.c.
	Silenced 'multiple definition of cpp symbols' warning by removing unnecessary
	inclusion of 'cadef.h' vs. 'dbAccess.h'

	20100323 (Till Straumann):

	* BLDApp/src/devBLDMCastStatus.c: removed unnecessary inclusion
	of headers.

	20100323 (Till Straumann): Added 'ChangeLog' file.
