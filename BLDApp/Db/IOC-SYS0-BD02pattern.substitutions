# Abs:  LCLS pattern records for SYS0 BD02
#
# Name: IOC-SYS0-BD02pattern.substitutions
# 
# Macros: evrPatternAll.db - instantiates 120hz pattern records.
#	  Associated display is evrPatternDiags.edl.
#	DEVICE	Name of the IOC, IOC:<loca>:<unit> 
#
#	LINK4	Set to "" if the IOC is not slc-aware.  
#		Otherwise, set to "IOC:<loca>:<unit>:FANOUTSLC".  
#
#	LINK5,	Set to any record you want processed at 120hz after the timing
#	LINK6	pattern is received.  If not applicable, set to "".
#
#	TREF	Reference delay in nsec from the fiducial for this IOC.  Normally  
#		restored on reboot.  Nominal value is 1.03E6 nsec.  TREF is used 
#		with the TDES value for each device to calculate the actual delay 
#		updated in the EVR hardware:
#		EVR delay = TREF + TDES - event code delay from the fiducial
#
#	TS1ST	For 120hz operation, 2 of the 6 time slots (1,2,3,4,5,6,  
#	and	360hz apart) are used to update the pattern and timestamp for   
#	TS2ND	this IOC (pattern is used for beam sync acq).  The other 4 time    
#		slots are used for other projects.  Check with operations to find 
#		the time slots used for your project/run and fill them in.  For  
#		instance, for BC1 LCLS 2007 operation, time slots 1 and 4 were 
#		used so TS1ST was set to 1 and TS2ND was set to 4.  For IOCs that 
#		cannot acquire and process data at 120hz (data ready in 8.3 msec),  
#               set TS1ST to 0 to ignore the 1st timeslot and the pattern and 
#		timestamp will only update on time slot 4 at 60hz.
#
#	  evrEventAll.db - instantiates records for each event code.
#	  Associated display is evrEventDiags.edl.
